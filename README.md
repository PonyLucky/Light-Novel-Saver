# Light-Novel-Saver

## Summary
Save in a HTML file all chapters of your preferred Light Novel directly from its website.

The output file can't be simplier in its architecture so it will be converted nicely in any format (EPUB, PDF, etc)) with metadata if you go on the advised converter on the page.

## Fonctionalities
Currently websites supported:
* www.lightnovelstranslations.com
* www.lightnovelworld.com

## Informations
If you see a supported website not working, please notify us with the **Issues** Pannel, add the **URL** so we can fix it.

Same, if you want us to implement a new website. Just say the word.

## More importantly
Enjoy your book ;)
