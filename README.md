# Light-Novel-Saver
![Presentation Project](local/img/Light-Novel-Saver.jpg)

## Summary
Save in a HTML file all chapters of your preferred Light Novel directly from its website.

The output file can't be simplier in its architecture so it will be converted nicely in any format (EPUB, PDF, etc)) with metadata if you go on the advised converter on the page.

## Requirements
Install this [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc/related?hl=en-US)
to be able to load content from other websites. (_And turn it '**ON**'_).

## How to use
